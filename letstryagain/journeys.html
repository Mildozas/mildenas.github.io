          <h1>ZAKOPANE</h1>
          <p>
         The first city, which I recommend for everyone to visit is called Zakopane located in Poland. It is a popular destination for mountaineering, skiing, and tourism. The prices are relatively low for accommodation and overall purchases. There are many trails for hiking in the summer, and many mountains to slide off in the winter! Of course, this city is loved by a lot of locals and tourists, hence you can expect traffic and wait in lines, however, I do think it is worth it and a great time is guaranteed!

          <h1>TBILISI</h1>
          <p>
            The second most favorite city of all time for me is Tbilisi located in Georgia. Tbilisi is the capital city of Georgia, hence providing many attractions to the tourists. Tbilisi has a great day and nightlife, there are many unique restaurants, cafes, and bars, that provide various dishes. Strictly talking about Georgian food, the most delicious for me was a dish called hachapuri, which is a traditional Georgian dish of cheese-filled bread. On the right, you can see a picture of various spices, which were sold at a market. We bought some to take back home, to spice meals up.

          <h1>BORJOMI RESORT (GEORGIA)</h1>
          <p>
      Borjomi city and resort is located in the Samtskhe-Javakheti region. It is a balneo-climatic resort. The main treatment is mineral water, which is used for drinking and balneological procedures. I always loved Borjomi water, which I could get at the nearest supermarket, so the idea of traveling to the Borjomi resort and tasting the "true" water from the fountain sounded wonderful. I did not regret one thing, Borjomi resort was relaxing, with a good share of attractions, and most importantly the mineral water tasted wonders, although the smell wasn't too good.

      <h1>ROME (ITALY)</h1>
      <p>
I have been to Italy before and I have been to Bolognia and Venice, however have never experienced the beauty of Rome and I will travel next year in spring. The city of Rome holds a lot of heritage, an ancient gladiatorial arena, the Colosseum, and many other attractions. I have heard that the locals are very kind, and of course, the Italian cuisine makes me want to come back!

              <h1>BARCELONA (SPAIN)</h1>
              <p>
The same story here, as I have been to Spain before, I experienced the capital Madrid, and the resort Malaga, however, I have never been to Barcelona. Meaning, that I need to travel to Barcelona. As I heard from many of my friends, who visited Barcelona, that Barcelona is wonderful and has everything to offer, going from food to architecture as well as good weather! The Barcelona trip will happen in summer - June, I hope it will be not too hot. One day I would like to live in Spain.
